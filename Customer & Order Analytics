-- In this SQL project, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to calculate data about customers and their order data. 

-- Determining how many orders were placed in January
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- Determining how many orders were placed for an iPhone in January
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- Pulling all customer account numbers for all February orders
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- Determining the cheapest product sold in January and its price
SELECT distinct Product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

-- Determining the total revenue for each product sold in January
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

-- Determining which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and the total revenue
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), sum(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

-- Determining how many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February and the average amount spent for those customers
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- Determining all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and how many of each were sold
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)
